# Build a dApp Using Waku (Decentralized Communication) and Vue.js

Hi Frens ðŸ‘‹!

Did you know that far beyond being a mere industry buzzword, decentralized communication represents a strategic response to the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized systems? By prioritizing privacy, security, and censorship resistance, decentralized communication becomes an indispensable component in the toolkit of web developers.

Traditional centralized communication systems have long struggled with issues of censorship, single points of failure, and privacy concerns. With the rise of Web 3 and blockchain technology, decentralized communication solutions like Waku are emerging as a promising alternative. Waku offers a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging system that is resilient to censorship, scalable, and secure, making it an ideal choice for dApp developers looking to build next-generation applications.

This article will guide you on how to build a decentralized application (dApp) using Waku, an uncompromising decentralized communication protocol, and Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Before diving into the hands-on development aspects of this article, I recommended that you have a basic understanding Vue.js, familiarity with Tailwind CSS for UI styling, and a grasp of web3.js for seamless wallet integration. If these technologies are new to you, no problem â€“ this guide is meticulously create for all level of expertise, providing step-by-step guidance at every level.

At the end of this article, not only will you have a fully functional Vue.js dApp, you will learn about the architecture of Waku, its various use cases, and how to integrate it into your Vue.js application. Additionally, you will discover how to deploy your application to IPFS or a hosting service like Vercel, ensuring that your dApp is accessible and available to your users.
