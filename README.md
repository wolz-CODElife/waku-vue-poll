# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Starter Template

Welcome to the Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite starter template! This template provides a solid foundation for developing Vue.js applications with TypeScript using the Vite build tool. To get started, follow the steps below:

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project
Before cloning this project, fork the repository first then run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/waku-vue-poll.git
cd your-vue-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We'll use npm to install these dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the App
To start the app in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, and you can view your Vue app at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make will automatically trigger hot module replacement, making the development process smooth and efficient.

### Recommended IDE Setup
For an enhanced development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (disable Vetur if enabled)
3. [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)

### Type Support For .vue Imports in TS
To handle type information for .vue imports, we use vue-tsc for type checking instead of the default tsc CLI. In your editor, ensure you have the TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar) installed to make the TypeScript language service aware of .vue types.

If you find the standalone TypeScript plugin not performant enough, you can enable Volar's Take Over Mode for a more efficient development experience.

### Additional Information
For more information on using Vue 3 \<script setup\> SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

Feel free to explore the template, customize it to fit your project, and start building awesome Vue.js applications! If you have any questions or run into issues, refer to the documentation or open an issue on GitHub. Happy coding!
