Hi frens! 🚀

I built a real-time voting poll dApp using Vue 3 and @Waku_org, a decentralized communication protocol. Here is an article about it: [INSERT LINK]

🧵 In summary...

1/ Connecting with Waku:
- Integrated Waku into my Vue.js app using @waku/sdk. 
- Set up a Waku light node for efficient communication.
- Chose a content topic (`/{application-name}/{version}/{content-topic-name}/{encoding}`) to categorize poll messages.

2/ Connect Wallet
- Implement authentication by connecting user's wallet using web3.js
- Used wallet address as poll sender identifier.

3/ Real-time Voting Experience:
- Users can create polls seamlessly.
- Leveraging Waku's efficient light push protocol for streaming poll data
- Waku's decentralized architecture ensures secure and censorship-resistant communication, fostering transparency in the voting process. 🗳️✨

4/ Peer-to-Peer Messaging:
- Waku enables peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need for a centralized server.
- Participants exchange votes and poll updates directly, enhancing the overall user experience. 🤝

5/ Privacy First:
- Waku empowers the dApp with privacy-centric features.
- Users can cast votes without concerns about metadata harvesting, putting privacy at the forefront of the voting experience. 🛡️🔐

6/ Use Cases Beyond Voting:
- Waku's adaptability extends beyond voting polls, and includes use cases such as:
    - Gaming 🎮
    - Supply Chain 🚧
    - Social Media 📱

7/ Huge shoutout to @Waku_org for revolutionizing decentralized communication!
Waku's robust features make it the perfect backbone for real-time interactions in my dApp. 🙌
